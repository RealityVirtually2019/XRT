# Example Scene: Selection

This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for combining
physical world raycast with virtual raycast, as well as interacting with
virtual objects when the raycast hits.

The ray is emitted from the correct position that intersects both the physical
world and virtual objects. When a virtual object is hit, the object changes
colors.

## Bumper
Press the Bumper to cycle raycast modes: controller, head, and eyes.

## Trigger
When you squeeze the trigger, an expanding visual effect is activated if the
ray is pointed at a virtual object.

## Calibrating the controller
When calibrated, the position and orientation of the virtual controller tracks
the physical controller.

For accurate controller calibration, be sure to point the controller towards
your forehead at eye-level when you first turn it on.

To calibrate the controller:
  1. Press Home to display a static model of the controller.
  2. Orient your physical controller in the exact same position and direction
     as the static model of the controller in the scene.
  3. Press Home to return to regular mode.

## MLRemote
The Calibration step is removed for Simulator.
