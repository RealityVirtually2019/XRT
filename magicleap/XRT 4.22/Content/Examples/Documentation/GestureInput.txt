# Example Scene: Gesture Input

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using gestures.

The UI depicts all the recognized gestures. As you perform these gestures with
your hands, the example highlights the gesture it detects you are performing,
and prints both the name of the gesture and the confidence percentage.

The confidence percentage specifies how confident we are that the gesture you
are performing is the gesture we think it is.
