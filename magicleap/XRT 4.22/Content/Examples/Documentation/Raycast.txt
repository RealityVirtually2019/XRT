# Example Scene: Raycast

This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for raycasting
by displaying cursors where the rays hit. There are three raycast modes:
controller, head, and eyes.

We display cursors at the ray collision points by subscribing to the raycast
event callback.

## Bumper
Press the Bumper to cycle through the raycast modes: controller, head, eyes, and all.

## Calibrating the controller
When calibrated, the position and orientation of the virtual controller tracks
the physical controller.

For accurate controller calibration, be sure to point the controller towards
your forehead at eye-level when you first turn it on.

To calibrate the controller:
 1. Press Home to display a static model of the controller.
 2. Orient your physical controller in the exact same position and direction
    as the static model of the controller in the scene.
 3. Press Home to return to regular mode.

## MLRemote
- The Calibration step is removed for Simulator.
