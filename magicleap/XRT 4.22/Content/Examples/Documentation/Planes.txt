# Example Scene: Planes

Description:
This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for detecting
surfaces and displaying planes.

The scene detects surfaces and displays the planes in your environment as you
look around. Planes can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonals, and the scene
textures surfaces differently according to both untagged and semantically tagged
planes (floors, walls, ceiling).

The UI text depicts the current number of planes and the maximum number of
possible planes.

## Bumper
Toggles the texturing mode for planes.

## Touchpad Swipe Up/Down
Sizes the bounding box for planes generation.
(0, 0, 0) size denotes an infinite size bounding box.

## Touchpad Radial Scroll
Rotate the bounding box.

## Trigger + Bumper
Drag the bounding box around the environment centered on the cursor.

## Swipe Right/Left
Modify texturing parameters based on the semantic tag of the planes 
the cursor is positioned over.
