# Example Scene: Meshing

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using the
meshing functionality.

The scene provides several examples of changing the way rendering and physics
interact with the meshing results. You can:
- visualize the mesh results.
- use the mesh results as occlusion data for virtual objects.
- control different parameters of the meshing query around bounding box
  position and size.
- shoot prefab spheres into the scene for physics interaction.

## Bumper
Cycles rendering modes:
- Wireframe. Wireframe mesh visualization from meshed results. Virtual objects
  are occluded.
- Occlusion. No visualization of mesh results.  Virtual objects are occluded.
- None.

## Home Button
Toggles the mesh type:
  - Block. Meshes are broken into 1 meter block sections and updated
    individually. Any blocks partially inside the bounding box are updated.
  - Full. A single large mesh clipped to the defined bounding box.

## Touchpad Swipe Up/Down
Sizes the bounding box for planes generation.
(0, 0, 0) size denotes an infinite size bounding box.

## Touchpad Radial Scroll
Rotate the bounding box.

## Trigger + Bumper
Drag the bounding box around the environment, centered on the cursor.

## Trigger
Shoots a ball into the scene to demonstrate occlusion and physics.
